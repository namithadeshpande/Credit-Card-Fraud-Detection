# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This repository describes my group project on Credit Card Fraud Detection. 

# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused drastic decline in the cash usage with everything slowly turning online these days. This has given rise to an unprecedented surge in contactless payments. The significant increase in credit card transactions, both online and in-person, has resulted in increased fraudulent transactions. Fraudulent methods are becoming more sophisticated and difficult for traditional fraud detection software to identify. Therefore, companies need a more advanced approach and are exploring machine learning technologies because they can handle the large amount of data and discover anomalies that humans may overlook.

# Data Selection

The dataset we used was taken from Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. This dataset contains European cardholder transactions from September 2013. It was collected and analyzed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (UniversiteÃÅ Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.	

Details of the dataset include the following:
* 284,807 transactions that occurred in the span of two days.
* 492 transactions are fraudulent transactions

# Project Objectives
Our primary goal is to analyze the given credit card dataset using different data mining and machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that were actually fraudulent. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our objective is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.
